# Uis Areospace Borealis 2.1 GUI

## Borealis 2.1 GUI
Borealis 2.1 is model rocket with colabarative work with other bachelor theisis and Uis Areospace orginazation. The goal of borealis 2.1 is to be an improvement of Borealis 1.0. One of the biggest lessons we learned from Borealis 1.0 is to not have a manual button for start data recording as before launch it was forgotten. 

### Technology
In Borealis 1.0 python PyQT was mainly used. In Borealis 2.1 we plan to use .Net and react because it provides more tools to make an GUI.

## How to Install and Run the Project
To run the Application you will need .Net 8 and Node.js installed. If youre not familiar with Node.js this [file](https://github.com/Kanskikuro/UIS-AeroSpace-GUI-Bac-2024/blob/main/Borealis2tsx/borealis2tsx.client/Necessities.md) will tell you how to run the applicaiton.

Since the application is still in development you will need to type in the console. This is because npm install only installs dependencies for client not server.

```console
dotnet restore
```
