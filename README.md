# Uis Areospace Borealis 2.1 GUI

## Borealis 2.1
Borealis 2.1 is Uis Areospace model rocket which has colabarative work with other bachelor theisis. The goal of borealis 2.1 is to be an improvement of Borealis 1.0. One of the biggest lessons we learned from Borealis 1.0 is to not have a manual button for start data recording as before launch it was forgotten. Since the Borealis 1.0 crashed 700m/s into the ground the locally saved data was lost thus there were no data from Borealis 1.0. 

## Description

### Technology
In Borealis 1.0 python PyQT was mainly used. In Borealis 2.1 we plan to use .Net and react because it provides more tools to make an GUI.

## How to Install and Run the Project

Since the application is still in development you will need to type in the console. This is because npm install only installs dependencies for client not server.
